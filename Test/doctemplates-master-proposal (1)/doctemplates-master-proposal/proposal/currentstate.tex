Explain what the current state of the topic is. This depends a lot on the concrete topic.
For example, you could write about: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item What is a trivial (not suboptimal) way to solve x?
  \item How is x usually solved in practice? 
  \item What are typical ingredients/techniques to construct the systems we are interested in?
  \item How does \cite{testref} solve the problem?
  \item What does the algorithm in \citet{testref} do (roughly)? 
  \item \dots
\end{itemize}
