Secure multiparty-computation (MPC) is a concept for securely computing (potentially probabilistic) functions with multiple parties involved. Each party has private input which must not be disclosed to the other parties. Based on these, the different parties jointly execute a protocol to obtain the functions result.
In this context security refers to the privacy of parties' inputs and correctness. To achieve privacy the protocol has to ensure that no information about one party's input is leaked to any other parties. Correctness is attained when the computed result equals the functions output based on the given input.\\
\ \\Secure multiparty-computation has many practical areas of application, one being stable matching algorithms. Matching algorithms are used to match members of two different sets to each other with regards to their respective preferences. A stable matching is achieved when there are no two members (one from each set) that aren't matched to each other, such that they would rather be matched to each other than to their assigned matches.\\ Such algorithms are used to for example match residents to residency programs or students to public schools [TODO Zitat]. Obviously the best solution would be that every member is assigned to their first preference, but in reality this is rarely possible. Stable matchings are a desirable solution in such cases to still achive a high level of member satisfaction and in some sense fairness.\\
One solution for computing a stable matching is the Gale-Shapley algorithm, developed by David Gale and Lloyd Shapley [TODO Zitat], which will also be the one we are interested in. \\
To provide a solution which is more applicable in reality without sacrificing security, Doerner et al. [TODO Zitat] introduce a new oblivious data strucure called "Oblivious Linked Multi-List" and make use of it during the execution of the Gale-Shapley algorithm. The data structure uses data arrays combined with a method by Zahur et al. [TODO Zitat] to obliviously permutate them. This provides the means to obliviously access data, thus hiding access patterns and the derivable information. The authors claim that using the Gale-Shapley algorithm combined with the Oblivious Linked Multi-List ensures security in the honest-but-curious attacker model. Honest-but-curious attackers don't acitvely intefere with the protocol. They follow instructions correctly and act as expected but try to learn more from the execution than they are supposed to. This could for example be learning about one party's preferences based on the order they are accessed in. Even though the authors give a rough intuition provided in the form of explaining arguments as to why security holds in this setting, it has not been formally proven yet.
