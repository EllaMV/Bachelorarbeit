Secure multiparty-computation (MPC) is a concept for securely computing functions with multiple parties involved. In this context security refers to the different parties' private inputs' confidentiality. The goal is to collectively execute a protocol and as a result obtain the wanted output without the necessity to reveal private data. \\
Secure multiparty-computation yields many practical areas of application, one being stable matching algorithms. Matching algorithms are used to match members of two different sets to each other with regards to their respective preferences. Such algorithms are used to for example match residents to residency programs or students to public schools [TODO Zitat]. A stable matching is achieved when there are no two members (one from each set) that aren't matched to each other, such that they would rather be matched to each other than to their assigned matches. Obviously the best solution would be that every member is assigned to their first preference, but in reality this is rarely possible. Stable matchings are a desirable solution in such cases to still achive a high level of member satisfaction and in some sense fairness.\\
One solution for computing a stable matching is the Gale-Shapley algorithm, developed by David Gale and Lloyd Shapley [TODO Zitat], which will also be the one we are interested in. More precisely we will examine a newly constructed data structure for obliviously managing data in combination with the classic Gale-Shapley algorithm, which yields a supposedly secure version.\\
