This template contains some hints of what to write in each section.
\emph{This is just an example.} There are good reasons to deviate from it. These are just some ideas to get started. 

For the introduction:
\begin{itemize}
  \item What general topic are we interested in, why does it matter (e.g., where is it used, what problem does it solve)?
  \item Explain some more background for the topic, help the reader (who may have never heard of the topic) understand what you are talking about.
\end{itemize}
(Tip: make such a bullet point list for yourself (with more concrete talking points) for all sections, \emph{then} start writing text)
