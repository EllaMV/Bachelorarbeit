Explain what the current state of the topic is. This depends a lot on the concrete topic.
For example, you could write about: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item What is a trivial (not suboptimal) way to solve x?
  \item How is x usually solved in practice? 
  \item What are typical ingredients/techniques to construct the systems we are interested in?
  \item How does \cite{testref} solve the problem?
  \item What does the algorithm in \cite{testref} do (roughly)? 
  \item \dots
\end{itemize}
Stable matching in the context of multiparty-computation comprises multiple different aspects, such as data access strategies or the underlying algorithm. Both of these are research topics of their own with several possible approaches and solutions. Naturally this yields various possibilities of combining them to solve the problem of securely computing a stable matching. \\
The approach presented by [TODO Zitat/Autoren] for example is based on the Gale-Shapley algorithm, whereas other solutions are based on [TODO anderen Algorithmus raussuchen].
