Stable matching in the context of multiparty-computation comprises multiple different aspects, such as data access strategies or the underlying algorithm. Both of these are research topics of their own with several possible approaches and solutions. Naturally this yields various possibilities of combining them to solve the problem of securely computing a stable matching. The approach presented by Doerner et al. [TODO Zitat] for example is based on the Gale-Shapley algorithm, whereas Blanton et al. [TODO Zitat] based their construction on Breadth First Search.\\
One way to securely compute a stable matching without expensive adjustments to classic protocols is to outsource the computation to a trusted third party. This way, both parties' inputs stay hidden to the other party and is only revealed to the commonly trusted party.\\
To avoid the efforts a trusted third party entails protocols that are carried out between the two parties only were developed. Some examples are the ones of Golle [TODO Zitat] with roughly O$(n^5)$ public-key operations [TODO formatieren] or the previously best implementation of the Gale-Shapley algorithm with a runtime of over 33 hours, working on sets of 512 members each [TODO Zitat].
