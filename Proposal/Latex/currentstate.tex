Stable matching in the context of multiparty-computation comprises multiple different aspects, such as data access strategies or the underlying algorithm. Both of these are research topics of their own with several possible approaches and solutions. Naturally this yields various possibilities of combining them to solve the problem of securely computing a stable matching. The approach presented by [TODO Zitat/Autoren] for example is based on the Gale-Shapley algorithm, whereas Blanton et al. [TODO Zitat] based their construction on Breadth First Search.\\
One way to securely compute a stable matching without expensive adjustments to classic protocols is to outsource the computation to a trusted third party. This way, both parties' inputs stay hidden to the other party and yet a relatively simple algorithm can be used. A requirement
