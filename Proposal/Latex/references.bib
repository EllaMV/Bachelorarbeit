abstract = {When a group of individuals and organizations wish to compute a stable matching---for
example, when medical students are matched to medical residency programs---they often
outsource the computation to a trusted arbiter in order to preserve the privacy of
participants' preferences. Secure multi-party computation offers the possibility of
private matching processes that do not rely on any common trusted third party. However,
stable matching algorithms have previously been considered infeasible for execution
in a secure multi-party context on non-trivial inputs because they are computationally
intensive and involve complex data-dependent memory access patterns.We adapt the classic
Gale-Shapley algorithm for use in such a context, and show experimentally that our
modifications yield a lower asymptotic complexity and more than an order of magnitude
in practical cost improvement over previous techniques. Our main improvements stem
from designing new oblivious data structures that exploit the properties of the matching
algorithms. We apply a similar strategy to scale the Roth-Peranson instability chaining
algorithm, currently in use by the National Resident Matching Program. The resulting
protocol is efficient enough to be useful at the scale required for matching medical
residents nationwide, taking just over 18 hours to complete an execution simulating
the 2016 national resident match with more than 35,000 participants and 30,000 residency
slots.},

abstract="One of the most fundamental notions of cryptography is that of simulation. It stands behind the concepts of semantic security, zero knowledge, and security for multiparty computation. However, writing a simulator and proving security via the use of simulation is a nontrivial task, and one that many newcomers to the field often find difficult. In this tutorial, we provide a guide to how to write simulators and prove security via the simulation paradigm. Although we have tried to make this tutorial as stand-alone as possible, we assume some familiarity with the notions of secure encryption, zero-knowledge, and secure computation.",

abstract = {This work treats the problem of designing data-oblivious algorithms for classical
and widely used graph problems. A data-oblivious algorithm is defined as having the
same sequence of operations regardless of the input data and data-independent memory
accesses. Such algorithms are suitable for secure processing in outsourced and similar
environments, which serves as the main motivation for this work. We provide data-oblivious
algorithms for breadth-first search, single-source single-destination shortest path,
minimum spanning tree, and maximum flow, the asymptotic complexities of which are
optimal, or close to optimal, for dense graphs.},

We show that the communication complexity of Golle's main protocol is substantially greater than what was claimed in that paper, in part due to surprising pathological behavior of Golle's variant of the Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm. We also develop new protocols in Golle's basic framework with greatly reduced communication complexity.",
