The problem with most current solutions is feasibility. Even though they guarantee security against different kinds of adversaries, they are not suited to be used in real world applications because of the operational time the different measures incur.\\
To provide a solution which is more applicable in reality without sacrificing security, [TODO Autoren] introduce a new oblivious data strucure called "[TODO Name Multilist]. The data structure uses [TODO] and provides the means to [TODO]. Even though the authors claim that usage of the [TODO Name Multilist] ensures security in the honest-but-curious attacker model, it has not been formally proven yet. The goal of this thesis is to formalize the rough intuition given by [TODO Autoren] and provide a formal proof.
To do so: simulation technique, proofing things seperately -> getting security for all
\ \\With regard to optional topics I see (there are) two possible scenarios. 
The first one is that in the course of working with the presented protocol and it's proof of security, it becomes clear that the assumption about the protocols security in context of the presented security model doesn't hold. In this case the first step would be to examine and explain the problems that arise. The insights gained could be used to identify a different, weaker security model that solves the problems the initial protocol implied. With such an altered security model a proof can then again be attempted.\\
The second one is that the proof turns out to be more straight forward than expected. A reasonable course of action could be to go a step further and investigate how the proven security transfers to other security models, such as an active attacker scenario.
