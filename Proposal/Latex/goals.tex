\begin{itemize}
  \item What's the problem with existing solutions? (i.e. with the stuff you explained in the previous section)
  \item What's the goal of the thesis in a nutshell? (Probably: solve that problem/analyze the solution suggested by Eti \cite{testref}/compare potential solutions/\dots)
  \item Then go into detail. What are the specifics of what you are going to do? Explain intermediate goals.
  \item Explain optional goals.
\end{itemize}
With regard to optional topics I see (there are) two possible scenarios. 
The first one is that in the course of working with the presented protocol and it's proof of security, it becomes clear that the assumption about the protocols security in context of the presented security model doesn't hold. In this case the first step would be to examine and explain the problems that arise. The insights gained could be used to identify a different, weaker security model that solves the problems the initial protocol implied. With such an altered security model a proof can then again be attempted.\\
The second one is that the proof turns out to be more straight forward than expected. A reasonable course of action could be to go a step further and investigate how the proven security transfers to other security models, such as an active attacker scenario.
