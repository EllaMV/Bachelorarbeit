\begin{itemize}
  \item What's the problem with existing solutions? (i.e. with the stuff you explained in the previous section)
  \item What's the goal of the thesis in a nutshell? (Probably: solve that problem/analyze the solution suggested by Eti \cite{testref}/compare potential solutions/\dots)
  \item Then go into detail. What are the specifics of what you are going to do? Explain intermediate goals.
  \item Explain optional goals.
\end{itemize}
